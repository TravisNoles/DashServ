DASHSERV CHANGELOG


v0.1.2 - (Pre-Release) - "Web"

*Reformatted entire codebase. DashServ is now going to use python and django.
App really wasn't meant to be a command line app, the web ui can use the command line,
but inside the web application rather than a terminal. This aligns better with what
I want to accomplish for the app while making it user-friendly and easy.


* Added Django Support and initialized files with litesql database file.
* Rewrote digitalocean into one file, added old code for reference.
* DigitalOcean droplet information
